## Welcome to your First Native Application!

In this application, you will be able to explore some basic concepts such as application role, versioned schemas and creating procedures and functions within a setup script.

For a deep dive into the world of Native Apps, please read the [official Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/native-apps-about) which goes in depth about many additional functionalities of this framework.

## Using the application after installation
To interact with the application after it has successfully installed in your account, switch to the application owner role first.
