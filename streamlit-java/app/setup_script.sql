-- This is the setup script that will run while installing your application instance in a consumer's account.
-- For more information on how to create setup file, visit https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/creating-setup-script

-- A general guideline to building this script looks like:
-- 1. Create application roles
CREATE APPLICATION ROLE app_public;

-- 2. Create a versioned schema to hold those UDFs/Stored Procedures
CREATE OR ALTER VERSIONED SCHEMA core;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA core TO APPLICATION ROLE app_public;

-- 3. Create UDFs and Stored Procedures using the java code you wrote in src/module-add, as shown below. 
CREATE or REPLACE FUNCTION core.add(num1 NUMBER, num2 NUMBER)
  RETURNS NUMBER
  LANGUAGE JAVA
  IMPORTS = ('/module-add/add-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar')
  HANDLER='com.snowflake.add.Add.two';

-- 4. Grant appropriate privileges over these objects to your application roles. 
GRANT USAGE ON FUNCTION core.add(NUMBER, NUMBER) TO APPLICATION ROLE app_public;

-- 5. Create a streamlit object using the code you wrote in you wrote in src/module-ui, as shown below. 
-- The `from` value is derived from the stage path described in snowflake.yml
CREATE STREAMLIT core.ui
     FROM '/streamlit/'
     MAIN_FILE = 'ui.py';


-- 6. Grant appropriate privileges over these objects to your application roles. 
GRANT USAGE ON STREAMLIT core.ui TO APPLICATION ROLE app_public;

-- A detailed explanation can be found at https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/adding-streamlit
